# BIKE-SHARING IN DES MOINES

Citi Bike is the largest bike share program in New York City. This program was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and it's a fun and affordable way to get around town. My friend Kate and I have though that could be a good idea to bring this type of business to Des Moines.  There are a couple of investors interested in this business; Kate is convinced that she can use her salesmanship, but she will need our data expertise and critical thinking skills to find a way to use some information from Citi Bike data base and transform it to a story to sell a viable product.
After a brief exploration of a small sample of Citi Bike data, we have an idea of how to create our story. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis that includes:

•	Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

•	The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

•	The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week


Additionally, we have incorporated 3 additional studies:

•	Gender breakdown

•	User type

•	Percentage per gender per user type



# RESULTS

A) Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders: as the description of the Citi Bike program mentioned, this graph shows that those bikes are used for short trips, most of the users (female and male) have rides between 5-6 minutes except for the “unknown users” that most of them use the bike for 11 minutes. There are no records for bikes with more than 1 hour of usage.

B) The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week: this graph shows that most of the rides (regardless the gender) occurs very early in the morning (between 6 am and 9am) or in the evening (between 5pm and 6pm) during the weekdays, nevertheless the story changes during the weekend, most of the rides take place during the day between 10 am and 5pm. This behavior combined with the max time of the ride in the previous graph give us the idea about the use that the users are giving to bicycles, which is to get to their work.

C) The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week: Most of the subscribers follow the behavior previously described, they ride during the weekdays and the customers (maybe the tourists) use this service during the weekend (especially on Saturdays).

Additionally, the two visualizations show the percentage of the type of users and the gender.  The gender breakdown gives us an important area of opportunity, we need to understand why there are more males than females.  We can prepare a strategy to attract more female users. The combination of those two visualizations gives us a bar chart where we can see that there isn’t a significant gender difference between the customer or subscriber.

# SUMMARY
Based on the data analyzed, we have enough evidence to convince the investors to make business together.  Although we have only used the month of August as a reference for information purposes because it is one of the months with the highest influx in the city, we see that the behavior of the weather is very similar between New York and Des Moines (see comparison) – source Google.

Although the size of the population can be a significant factor in the impact of the business, it is still a smaller-scale opportunity (see comparison) – source Google.
